# The-Goals-App
An application to keep your life seeking your goal

This application is a joined effort between myself (Spencer) and my friend and colleague John. We shared the passion to create
an application that would not only keep us focused on the moment by moment tasks that must be completed, but also the goals behind the
tasks. This gives direction and motivation to carry on, finish the monotony of life, and achieve goals that really matter. Over the course
of a few weeks we have found time to write what is here. It is and always will be my first personal project and I am quite proud to call it
that. It does still have much work to be done (a GUI, for instance), but that will come in the following weeks. For now, I am thankful we
made it thus far.
